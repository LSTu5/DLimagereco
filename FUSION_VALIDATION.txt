✓ FUSION TRAINING SETUP - VALIDATION COMPLETE

All checks passed. The fusion training pipeline is ready to use.

VALIDATED COMPONENTS:
─────────────────────

1. MODELS ✓
   • FusionModel - Dual-stream fusion architecture
   • SpatialBranch - RGB feature extraction with ResNet-style blocks
   • FrequencyBranch - FFT/SRM high-pass filter based feature extraction
   • All models instantiate correctly and perform forward passes

2. DATA LOADING ✓
   • DynamicDataset supports "fusion" mode (RGB + FFT)
   • get_dataloaders() configured for batch_size=24
   • Supports augmentation for spatial view, deterministic resize for freq view
   • Dataset handles real/fake classification from directory structure

3. TRAINING PIPELINE ✓
   • train_fusion.py: MixUp augmentation for both RGB and FFT branches
   • Uses torch.amp (automatic mixed precision) for efficiency
   • GradScaler, gradient clipping, and ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
   • Early stopping with patience=8, saves best model to best_fusion.pth

4. EVALUATION ✓
   • eval_fusion.py: Evaluates trained model on test set
   • Flexible checkpoint loading from multiple paths
   • Computes loss and accuracy metrics

5. DEPENDENCIES ✓
   • All imports work correctly (torch, torchvision, PIL, tqdm, pathlib)
   • No missing module dependencies

PYTHON SYNTAX ✓
   • train_fusion.py - No syntax errors
   • eval_fusion.py - No syntax errors
   • fusion_model.py - No syntax errors
   • spatial_model.py - No syntax errors
   • freq_model.py - No syntax errors
   • loaders.py - No syntax errors

READY TO TRAIN
──────────────
The fusion training script can now be executed with:
  python src/train_fusion.py

Expected behavior:
  • Loads data from rawdata/ subdirectories
  • Trains for up to 12 epochs with early stopping
  • Saves best model as best_fusion.pth
  • Logs loss and accuracy each epoch
